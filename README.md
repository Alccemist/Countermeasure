# Countermeasure 1.0.0
## Introduction
Countermeasure is a Python-based Discord bot designed to handle server-sized games that involve player statistics.
I was on a crunch for time when developing this bot, so forgive me for — and inform me of — any problems.
I am reachable on Discord @ ```.gamaliel``` .

## Quick Start
Before running anything, we should make sure we've an eligible Python version and ```requirements.txt``` installed.
I have used Python 3.12.4 to write this bot. Future versions are likely fine.
All commands should be ran inside ```Countermeasure/src```.
To install requirements, run:
```pip install -r required.txt```

  This bot comes with a console-based env creator for our convenience. We should enable Discord development mode and be familiar with creating a bot + intents so we can provide all the needed information.
To start the bot, run:
```Python main.py```
